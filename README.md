<h1>Tvc Computers </h1>

<p><em>"Hello, my name is Rodrigo Dias Lima, welcome to my gitHub page! 
<br><br>
Now I'm living in SÃ£o Paulo, Brazil. I have just droped the Information Systems university course so I can focus all my available time to learn and improve my abilities related with programming, and in a narrower perspective, with the Back-end development. From Flask to Spring, running across Python and Java, here I upload my code. 
<br><br>
As a way to keep learning, practicing and improving coding, I designed a youtube channel (actually there are two, but they have the same content). One of the main reasons, that I realized only after stating it, to build this project is not only to help other people, but also it works as a "tutorial" for myself. Many times when I'm coding and I deal with something which I know I have already done in the past but I'm not sure now, and then I remember that I have a video about it, its very helpful. So, in the link below you can access the channel.
<br><br>
In my free time I like to build some stuff related with computers ... I mean build computers. More precisely Mining Rigs. So at Tvc Computers, this is exactly what I do. You can check my work at the Instagram link below, or at the website www.tvvvvc.com
<br><br>
Feel free to use any piece of code available here. Also, if you have any question or just want to chat about code, please be my guest!
Hope you guys like my work. See you!!</em></p>
