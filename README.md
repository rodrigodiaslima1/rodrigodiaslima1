<h1>Welcome!</h1>

<p><em>"Hello, my name is Rodrigo Dias Lima, welcome to my gitHub page! 
<br><br>
  <h3>Who am I?</h3>
<em>"I'm a self-taught software development student from SÃ£o Paulo, Brazil. My main focus is to learn stuff related with back-end development. So, from Flask to Spring, walking through Python and Java, I always keep myself in touch with those technologies. Being a solo student is not that easy, so it's necessary to always being related with the learning processes, and to achieve this I'm always searching and enrolling myself in the best courses and projects available."</em>

  <br><br>
<em>"Feel free to use any piece of code available here. Also, if you have any question or just want to chat about code, be my guest!
  You can find all my contacts in this page."</em>

  <em>Hope you enjoy the content. <br>
    See you!</em>
