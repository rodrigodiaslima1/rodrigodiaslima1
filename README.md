<h1>Welcome!</h1>

<p><em>"Hello, my name is Rodrigo Dias Lima, welcome to my gitHub page! 
<br><br>
  <h3>Who am I?</h3>
<em>"I'm from SÃ£o Paulo, Brazil. I'm a self-taught Software Developement student. My main focus is to learn stuff related with back-end development. So, from Flask to Spring, walking through Python and Java, I always keep myself in touch with those technologies. Being a solo student is not that easy, so it's necessary to always being related with the learning processes, and to achieve this I'm always searching and enrolling myself in the best courses and projects available."</em>
  
<br><br>
  <h3>this.channel():</h3>
<em>"The this.channel() is my Youtube channel related with coding. There I frequently upload videos about the programming stuff which I'm studying, working with or maybe just refreshing my knowledge. I realized that keeping my code's videos available there in the channel, wasn't just good for people who could eventually learn something, but also was a very goud source for myself every time I would face some feature which I knew I had tackled, but just couldn't recall at the moment. So, there was some video of mine available to consultation. And it's nice the fact that sometimes you are going to have the same doubts about a subject. So hope you enjoy content there."</em>
<br><br>
  
  <h3>Tvc Computers:</h3>
<em>"Tvc is a project related with building a Mining Rig. So in my free time I like to research about computers, investmts (specially cryptocurrencies) and so on.
  So you can check my work in this field in the Tvc Computers Instagram and also website."</em>
<br><br>
  <h3>Overal Considerations:</h3>
<em>"Feel free to use any piece of code available here. Also, if you have any question or just want to chat about code, be my guest!
  You can find all my contacts in this page."</em>
  
  <br><br>
  
  <em>Hope you enjoy the content. <br>
    See you!</em>
